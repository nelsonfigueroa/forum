# Shreddit

A clone of Reddit. Created to showcase my development abilities. Built on Ruby on Rails.

When a user is logged in, use different views. maybe something like /user/posts
Different routes as well. 

It's either try to make this DRY or repeat code to keep everything isolated.

If a user is logged in, they should have a "Home" tab that only shows top posts from all the subs they're subscribed to.
They should also have an "Account" tab to manage their user details
