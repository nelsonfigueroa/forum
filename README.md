# Forum

A Ruby on Rails application inspired by Reddit. Created to showcase my development abilities. A Dockerfile is included to make development and previewing more easy.

You can preview the application by pulling the pre-built image from DockerHub and running it:

```
docker run -p 3000:3000 nfigueroa/forum
```

Or if you want to build and run the application yourself:

```
docker-compose up
```

Then browse to `localhost:3000` in your browser.
